### The user will use a dropdown list to see the players team, position, and projected fantasy points. For the NBA API, it will include projected stats for season 2020. The stats would be FG percent, FT percent, rebounds, assist, steals, blocks, turnovers, and points. This will help the user determine if that player is worth drafting into their fantasy team.
