# NFL and NBA FANTASY FOOTBALL DRAFT INFO API
## Jackie Cheung


### The user will use a dropdown list to see the players draft position, projected fantasy points, and fantasy points of last year. I can also try to create a stat to help users see how much fantasy points does each player generate in each game for the NFL Fantasy. For the NBA API, it will include projected stats for season 2020. The stats would be FG percent, FT percent, rebounds, assist, steals, blocks, turnovers, and points. This will help the user determine if that player is worth drafting into their fantasy team.
